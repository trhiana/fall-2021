        <h2><a href="#">Setting a global standard for leadership in action: read Ashesi's 2020 Annual Report</a></h2>
        <p>30th July 2021 | By: Patrick Awuah</p>
        <p>
            Dear Friends,<br>
            <br>
            It is my pleasure to present <a href="https://www.ashesi.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/AR-2020.pdf">Ashesi’s 2020 Annual Report</a>, 
            which details the challenges and triumphs our community experienced in a year unlike any other. In March of 2020, 
            Ashesi students were among the first in Africa to resume their learning, thanks to work 
            we started over a decade ago to move our learning and community systems online. <br>
            <br>
            Our faculty have continued to work together with students since then to develop and deploy 
            new methods of instruction; university administrators also helped ensure that all necessary 
            tools, resources and support systems were in place to support the transition. Donors, friends 
            and advocates stepped up to welcome students into their homes as we went on lockdown; helped 
            fund emergency financial aid for disadvantaged students; and enabled Ashesi to support incomes 
            for all auxiliary staff who would have otherwise been out of work with campus closed. Also 
            importantly, we pressed on with our annual Education Collaborative, convening university leaders 
            and stakeholders across Africa and the world with a special focus on the pandemic and successful 
            strategies for ensuring effective learning during and beyond 2020. <br>
            <br>
            The lessons of 2020 and the leadership gaps in Africa’s social and economic infrastructure that 
            they have reminded the world of, bring even more urgency to our work. For the last two decades we 
            have steadily grown our capability to educate ethical, entrepreneurial leaders on the continent.
            The pandemic’s test of our institution, and the Ashesi community’s exemplary response to it, indicate 
            how grounded our model has become. The work that continues to happen at Ashesi, and the gains made since 
            our very first class began in 2002, will be key to deepening our impact as we enter Ashesi’s third decade.<br>
            <br>
            Earlier this year, I read a story that deeply reminded me of the power of cumulative effort – sometimes
            over several decades – to create a breakthrough for global challenges. It was the story of Katalin Karikó,
            a Hungarian-born researcher who had put her career on the line for nearly four decades trying to harness 
            the power of messenger RNA (mRNA). Karikó persisted through personal crises, career setback, and a lack of 
            belief from the scientific community in her ideas. In 2020, her research work was seminal to the development 
            Moderna and Pfizer/BioNTech’s highly effective COVID-19 vaccines. Karikó reminds me of many within the Ashesi 
            community - faculty, administrators, alumni and students – who have been engaged in quiet, diligent work to 
            transform Africa. <br>
            <br>
            These efforts are establishing a foundation for the future success of the young leaders we are working with today. 
            When Africa’s tipping point arrives, and the continent emerges as a stronger force for good in the world, we will 
            look back at these years of work as having made an immense difference. This Annual Report highlights some of the Ashesi 
            stories that have inspired me this year, and I hope they inspire you as well. I am thankful to everyone who is with us on 
            this journey, and the continued support that makes Ashesi’s work possible. <br>
            <br>
            In the spirit of Ashesi, <br>Patrick Awuah.
